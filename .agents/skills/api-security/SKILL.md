# api-security {Security} (v1.0)
> **"Security is not a feature. It's every feature's foundation."**
## Purpose
Firebase App Check (reCAPTCHA v3). API key restrictions. Rate limiting in Cloud Functions. Request signing. [EXPLICIT]
**When to use:** Implementing authentication, authorization, or security measures in Firebase projects.
## Core Principles
1. **Law of Auth First:** No endpoint without authentication. Firebase ID token verification is mandatory. [EXPLICIT]
2. **Law of Least Privilege:** Users get minimum permissions needed. Custom claims define roles. [EXPLICIT]
3. **Law of Defense in Depth:** Client validation + Security Rules + Cloud Functions validation. Three layers. [EXPLICIT]
## Core Process
### Phase 1: Assess security requirements from spec.
### Phase 2: Implement auth, authorization, and security measures.
### Phase 3: Audit with OWASP checklist. Test rules with emulator.
## Validation Gate
- [ ] Auth implemented on all endpoints
- [ ] Security rules cover all Firestore collections
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 mitigations addressed
- [ ] Secrets in Secret Manager (not in code)
- [ ] Privacy compliance documented

## Usage

Example invocations:

- "/api-security" — Run the full api security workflow
- "api security on this project" — Apply to current context


## Assumptions & Limits

- Assumes access to project artifacts (code, docs, configs) [EXPLICIT]
- Requires English-language output unless otherwise specified [EXPLICIT]
- Does not replace domain expert judgment for final decisions [EXPLICIT]

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Empty or minimal input | Request clarification before proceeding |
| Conflicting requirements | Flag conflicts explicitly, propose resolution |
| Out-of-scope request | Redirect to appropriate skill or escalate |
