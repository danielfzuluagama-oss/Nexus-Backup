  "create brand writing guidelines", or "calibrate tone for a proposal",
  or mentions voice pillars, tone calibration, or vocabulary mapping. [EXPLICIT]
  It applies configurable brand voice and tone guidelines by reading brand config
  to adapt voice pillars, content type calibration, vocabulary mapping, and writing rules. [EXPLICIT]
  Use this skill whenever the user needs branded written content or voice
  consistency checks, even if they don't explicitly ask for "brand voice". [EXPLICIT]

# Brand Voice & Tone

Apply configurable brand voice to any written content. Reads brand identity from a config file and adapts voice pillars, vocabulary, tone calibration, and writing patterns accordingly. [EXPLICIT]

## Brand Configuration

Search for brand voice config in this order:
1. Path passed as argument
2. `./brand-voice.json` in working directory
3. `./brand-config.json` (voice section)
4. `~/.claude/brand-voice.json`

### Config Schema

```json
{
  "brand": {
    "name": "YourBrand",
    "positioning": "Your positioning statement",
    "claim": "Your main tagline or claim",
    "claimVariants": [
      "Variant 1. Tagline.",
      "Variant 2. Tagline."
    ],
    "philosophy": "Core philosophy or methodology"
  },
  "voice": {
    "pillars": [
      {
        "name": "Pillar Name",
        "description": "What this pillar means",
        "guidelines": ["Guideline 1", "Guideline 2"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "vocabulary": {
    "preferred": {
      "generic term": "brand term",
      "deliverables": "results"
    },
    "avoid": ["synergy", "leverage", "seamless"]
  },
  "toneCalibration": {
    "proposals": "confident + structured",
    "marketing": "warm + energetic",
    "technical": "clear + precise",
    "internal": "friendly + direct",
    "crisis": "calm + accountable"
  },
  "closingLines": {
    "external": ["Closing line 1", "Closing line 2"],
    "proposals": ["Proposal closing 1"],
    "internal": ["Internal closing 1"]
  }
}
```

### Default (No Config)

If no config found, use professional neutral voice: clear, direct, active voice, no jargon, human-centered. Prompt user to provide brand config for branded output. [EXPLICIT]

## Voice Pillars

Read from `voice.pillars` in config. Default 4-pillar framework:

### 1. Close & Human
Companion, not vendor. Warm, direct, personal. Talk TO people, not AT them. Use "we" and "you" naturally. [EXPLICIT]

### 2. Confident & Grounded
Lead with facts, not adjectives. Active voice. Confidence without arrogance: "We deliver" not "We are proud to deliver."

### 3. Forward-Looking & Optimistic
Focus on progress, not perfection. Frame challenges as opportunities. End on a forward note. [EXPLICIT]

### 4. Simple & Direct
Short sentences. One idea per sentence. Avoid jargon when plain language works. Active verbs: build, deliver, transform, improve. [EXPLICIT]

## Writing by Content Type

### Headlines & Titles
Short, punchy, sentence case. Lead with action or aspiration. Optionally highlight one key word in brand primary color. [EXPLICIT]

### Body Copy
2-4 sentences per block. Active voice. End with forward-looking statement or CTA. Subtly reference brand philosophy. [EXPLICIT]

### Proposals & Reports
Open with client's challenge, not credentials. Data-anchor claims. Structure: Context > Approach > Expected Impact. Close with warm, direct invitation. [EXPLICIT]

### Social / LinkedIn
Start with human hook. Conversational, no buzzwords. Concrete insight or takeaway. End with tagline when appropriate. [EXPLICIT]

### Emails (External)
Clear subject (benefit or question). Reference specific context. One key message. Single CTA. Warm professional sign-off. [EXPLICIT]

### Slide Text
6-10 words max per headline. No full paragraphs. "Eyebrow + headline" structure. Tagline on closing slides. [EXPLICIT]

### Internal Communications
Same warmth, slightly more informal. Reference team identity. Celebrate small wins, frame feedback as improvement. [EXPLICIT]

## Language Rules

**Do use:** We, our, you, your. Build, deliver, transform, improve, create, evolve. Sentence case for headlines.

**Avoid:** Synergy, leverage, seamless, cutting-edge, world-class, innovative (unless earned). Passive voice. Exclamation marks in professional contexts. ALL CAPS. Vague superlatives without proof.

Read additional rules from `vocabulary.preferred` and `vocabulary.avoid` in config. [EXPLICIT]

## Tone Calibration

Read from `toneCalibration` in config. Default matrix:

| Context | Tone | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Corporate proposals | Confident + structured | Facts-forward, evidence-based |
| Marketing / social | Warm + energetic | Human stories, optimism |
| Recruiting / talent | Inspiring + honest | Growth mindset |
| Technical docs | Clear + precise | Plain language |
| Events / launches | Bold + celebratory | Claims front and center |
| Internal | Friendly + direct | Informal, motivating |
| Crisis / issues | Calm + accountable | Transparent, solution-focused |

## Claim & Tagline System

Read from `brand.claim` and `brand.claimVariants`. [EXPLICIT]

**Rules:**
- Claims work as standalone statements
- Extended variants follow the pattern: "[Adjective] [noun]. [Separator]."
- Positioning tag works as sign-off or label

## Manifesto Tone Pattern

For high-impact copy, use anaphoric structure from brand philosophy:
```
Every [moment/person/project/step] [is/has/connects]. [EXPLICIT]
That's why we [action]. [EXPLICIT]
```

## Assumptions & Limits

- Voice config is optional; skill works with defaults but output is generic
- Cannot invent brand identity — needs config or user-provided brand context
- Tone calibration is a dial, not a switch — content types blend tones
- Vocabulary mapping covers common substitutions; domain-specific terms need explicit config
- Not a copywriting skill — provides voice guidelines; actual copy requires creative judgment

## Edge Cases

- **No brand config:** Use neutral professional defaults; note output is unbranded
- **Conflicting tone context (crisis + marketing):** Crisis tone always wins in blended contexts
- **Non-English content:** Apply same voice pillars; adapt vocabulary to target language idioms
- **Multiple brands:** Accept brand config path as argument; switch per invocation

## Validation Gate

- [ ] Brand config loaded (or defaults applied with note)
- [ ] Voice pillars applied consistently throughout content
- [ ] Vocabulary uses preferred terms, avoids banned terms
- [ ] Tone matches content type calibration
- [ ] Active voice dominant (< 15% passive)
- [ ] Headlines in sentence case
- [ ] Closing line appropriate to context
- [ ] No jargon without explanation
