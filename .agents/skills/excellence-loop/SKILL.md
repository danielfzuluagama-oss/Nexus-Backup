# Excellence Loop

Applies a rigorous 10-point quality rubric to every deliverable artifact, identifying gaps and iterating until all criteria score above threshold — transforming good work into excellent work. [EXPLICIT]

## Guiding Principle

> *"Excellence is not a destination but a loop. Ship when every dimension scores above threshold, not when you run out of time."*

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Select the Rubric
1. Load the 10-point excellence rubric appropriate for the artifact type. [EXPLICIT]
2. For technical documents: completeness, accuracy, evidence, structure, actionability, clarity, diagrams, consistency, audience-fit, next-steps. [EXPLICIT]
3. For code deliverables: correctness, readability, testability, performance, security, maintainability, documentation, error-handling, naming, standards-compliance. [EXPLICIT]
4. Customize rubric weights based on artifact priority (critical vs. supporting). [EXPLICIT]
5. Set the threshold: minimum score per criterion (typically 7/10) and overall (typically 8/10). [EXPLICIT]

### Step 2 — Score the Artifact
1. Evaluate each criterion independently on a 1-10 scale. [EXPLICIT]
2. Provide specific evidence for each score: what is good, what is lacking. [EXPLICIT]
3. Identify the lowest-scoring criteria as priority improvement targets. [EXPLICIT]
4. Calculate the overall weighted score. [EXPLICIT]
5. Determine the verdict: PASS (all criteria >= threshold), ITERATE (specific criteria below), REWORK (overall below threshold). [EXPLICIT]

### Step 3 — Iterate on Gaps
1. For each criterion below threshold, define the specific improvement needed. [EXPLICIT]
2. Apply improvements in priority order (lowest scores first). [EXPLICIT]
3. Re-score only the modified criteria after each improvement pass. [EXPLICIT]
4. Track iteration count — if more than 3 iterations on the same criterion, escalate for review. [EXPLICIT]
5. Document what changed in each iteration for audit trail. [EXPLICIT]

### Step 4 — Certify and Archive
1. When all criteria pass, stamp the artifact with the excellence certification. [EXPLICIT]
2. Record the final scores and iteration history. [EXPLICIT]
3. Add the ghost menu with next-step actions. [EXPLICIT]
4. Update the artifact status from {WIP} to ready for review or {Aprobado}. [EXPLICIT]
5. Feed the scoring data into the lessons-learned tracker for continuous improvement. [EXPLICIT]

## Quality Criteria
- Every artifact is scored against a defined rubric before delivery.
- No criterion scores below the minimum threshold in the final version.
- Iteration history is documented showing progressive improvement.
- Rubric is calibrated quarterly based on feedback and lessons learned.

## Anti-Patterns
- Skipping the excellence loop due to time pressure ("good enough" mentality).
- Scoring all criteria at 10/10 without honest assessment (rubber stamping).
- Iterating endlessly on minor improvements (diminishing returns).
- Using the same rubric for all artifact types without customization.

## Usage

Example invocations:

- "/excellence-loop" — Run the full excellence loop workflow
- "excellence loop on this project" — Apply to current context


## Assumptions & Limits

- Assumes access to project artifacts (code, docs, configs) [EXPLICIT]
- Requires English-language output unless otherwise specified [EXPLICIT]
- Does not replace domain expert judgment for final decisions [EXPLICIT]

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Empty or minimal input | Request clarification before proceeding |
| Conflicting requirements | Flag conflicts explicitly, propose resolution |
| Out-of-scope request | Redirect to appropriate skill or escalate |
