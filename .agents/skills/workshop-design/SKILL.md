# Workshop Design

> "None of us is as smart as all of us." — Ken Blanchard

## TL;DR

Designs structured collaborative workshops — event storming, impact mapping, design sprints, and inception sessions — with detailed agendas, facilitation scripts, and artifact templates. Use this skill when you need to align a group, explore a domain, or make collaborative decisions efficiently.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Discover
- Define the workshop objective: what decision or artifact should result
- Identify participants: roles, number, experience level, remote/in-person
- Assess constraints: duration, tools available (Miro, FigJam, physical), preparation time

### Step 2: Analyze
- Select the appropriate workshop format for the objective:
  - **Event Storming**: domain exploration and process discovery
  - **Impact Mapping**: goal → actors → impacts → deliverables alignment
  - **Design Sprint**: rapid prototyping and validation (5-day or compressed)
  - **Inception**: project kickoff with scope, risks, and team agreements
- Design the agenda with timeboxed activities and energy management

### Step 3: Execute
- Produce a detailed facilitation guide with timing, instructions, and transitions
- Create artifact templates (Miro boards, canvases, voting sheets)
- Write pre-workshop preparation instructions for participants
- Design warm-up activities and energizers appropriate to the group

### Step 4: Validate
- Verify the agenda achieves the stated objective within time constraints
- Confirm activities are appropriate for participant experience level
- Check that remote participants have equal participation opportunity
- Validate that outputs feed directly into downstream deliverables

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Workshop objective is specific and measurable
- [ ] Agenda is timeboxed with buffer for overruns
- [ ] Facilitation guide includes transition scripts and contingency activities
- [ ] Artifact templates are prepared and tested
- [ ] Evidence tags applied to all claims

## Anti-Patterns

- Death by sticky notes: activities without clear synthesis steps
- Workshop without follow-up: insights generated but never actioned
- Facilitator-as-participant: trying to contribute content while facilitating
