# Meeting Notes

> TL;DR — Transforms raw meeting input (transcript, rough notes, agenda) into structured
> minutes covering metadata, attendees, agenda items, discussion summaries, decisions log,
> and action items with assigned owners and deadlines. Outputs markdown and optionally a
> branded HTML document ready for distribution.

## When to Activate

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Direct request | "Write up meeting notes from this transcript" |
| Minutes formatting | "Format these as meeting minutes" |
| Spanish variant | "Redacta el acta de la reunion de hoy" |
| Post-meeting context | "Here are my rough notes from the standup" |
| Action item extraction | "Pull out the action items from this meeting" |

Activate when the user provides meeting content (transcript, notes, agenda) and needs
structured documentation. Do NOT activate for meeting planning (use `workshop-facilitator`)
or retrospective facilitation (use `retrospective-facilitation`).

## S1 — Input Processing & Metadata Extraction

### Accepted Input Formats

| Format | Processing |
|--------|-----------|
| Raw transcript | NLP extraction of speakers, topics, decisions |
| Bullet-point notes | Structure into agenda-aligned sections |
| Audio transcript paste | Clean filler words, attribute speakers |
| Agenda + outcomes | Map outcomes to each agenda item |
| Mixed / chaotic notes | Identify threads, group by topic |

### Metadata Block

Extract or ask for:

```markdown
## Meeting Metadata
- **Title**: [Meeting name]
- **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Time**: [HH:MM - HH:MM] [Timezone]
- **Location**: [Room / Video link]
- **Facilitator**: [Name]
- **Note-taker**: [Name or "AI-assisted"]
- **Attendees**: [Name (Role)] per person
- **Absent**: [Name (Role)] if applicable
```

If the user omits metadata fields, mark them `[NOT PROVIDED]` rather than guessing.

---

## S2 — Discussion Summary & Decision Log

### Discussion Summary Structure

For each agenda item:

```markdown
### [Agenda Item Title]

**Context**: Brief background (1-2 sentences).

**Discussion**:
- [Speaker] raised [point]. [Supporting detail].
- [Speaker] countered with [alternative view].
- Group consensus: [outcome summary].

**Status**: Resolved | Deferred | Escalated
```

Rules:
- Attribute statements to speakers when identifiable.
- Maintain neutral tone — do not editorialize or interpret intent.
- Summarize, do not transcribe verbatim (respect copyright and brevity).
- Flag unresolved disagreements explicitly.

### Decision Log

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Owner | Date |
|----|----------|-----------|-------|------|
| D1 | Adopt serverless for MVP | Cost reduction + faster iteration | CTO | 2026-03-27 |
| D2 | Delay mobile app to Q3 | Resource constraints | PM | 2026-03-27 |

Each decision gets a unique ID for traceability across future meetings.

---

## S3 — Action Items & Follow-up

### Action Item Format

| ID | Action | Owner | Due Date | Priority | Status |
|----|--------|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| A1 | Draft serverless architecture proposal | Maria R. | 2026-04-03 | High | Open |
| A2 | Schedule user testing sessions | Carlos P. | 2026-04-10 | Medium | Open |
| A3 | Review vendor contracts | Legal team | 2026-04-07 | High | Open |

Rules:
- Every action item must have an **owner** (person, not team, when possible).
- Every action item must have a **due date** (if not stated, suggest one and mark `[SUGGESTED]`).
- Priority levels: High, Medium, Low.
- Status on creation is always "Open".
- Actions without clear owners are flagged: `[OWNER NEEDED]`.

### Follow-up Section

```markdown
## Next Meeting
- **Date**: [Next meeting date or cadence]
- **Carry-over items**: [List deferred agenda items]
- **Pre-read**: [Documents to review before next meeting]
```

---

## S4 — Output Formatting & Distribution

### Markdown Output (Default)

Clean markdown file following the structure:
1. Metadata block
2. Attendees table
3. Agenda items with discussion summaries
4. Decision log table
5. Action items table
6. Follow-up / next meeting

Filename convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_meeting-title.md`

### Branded HTML Output (Optional)

When the user requests HTML output or distribution-ready format:

- **Brand tokens**: navy #122562 background header, gold #FFD700 accent on decision badges,
  blue #137DC5 for links and action item highlights.
- **Typography**: Poppins 600 for section headings, Inter 400 for body.
- **Layout**: dark header with meeting title and date, light body for readability,
  action items in a highlighted card section.
- **Print styles**: clean black-on-white with visible table borders.
- **Self-contained**: single HTML file, no external dependencies beyond Google Fonts.

### Distribution Checklist

- [ ] Review for sensitive information before sharing externally.
- [ ] Confirm all attendee names are spelled correctly.
- [ ] Verify action item owners have been notified.
- [ ] Attach to calendar invite for the next meeting.

## Trade-off Matrix

| Decision | Option A | Option B | Recommendation |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Detail level | Verbatim transcript | Executive summary | Summary with key quotes |
| Attribution | Name every speaker | Anonymize discussion | Attribute when relevant |
| Format | Markdown only | Markdown + HTML | Both — markdown for archive, HTML for distribution |
| Action item dates | Only stated dates | Suggest dates for undated items | Suggest with [SUGGESTED] tag |
| Language | Single language | Bilingual ES/EN | Match meeting language; bilingual if mixed |

---

## Assumptions & Limits

- Assumes the user provides accurate input; the skill does not verify claims made in meetings. [EXPLICIT]
- Does not record, transcribe, or access audio/video — works from provided text only. [EXPLICIT]
- Speaker attribution accuracy depends on input quality; ambiguous speakers are marked
  `[SPEAKER UNCLEAR]`. [INFERRED]
- Does not send emails, calendar invites, or notifications to attendees. [EXPLICIT]
- Decision IDs and action item IDs are session-scoped; cross-meeting tracking requires
  external tooling. [INFERRED]

---

## Edge Cases

1. **Transcript with no clear agenda** — Infer topic clusters from discussion flow; present
   as "Discussion Topics" rather than "Agenda Items" and note that no formal agenda was provided.
2. **Meeting with no decisions or action items** — Explicitly state "No decisions were recorded"
   and "No action items were identified" rather than omitting the sections.
3. **Highly technical meeting with jargon** — Preserve technical terms exactly as stated;
   add a glossary section at the end if 5+ specialized terms appear.
4. **Multilingual meeting (mixed ES/EN)** — Write notes in the dominant language; include
   key terms in both languages where they first appear: "sprint planning (planificacion de sprint)".

## Good vs Bad Example

### Good

```markdown
### API Migration Timeline

**Context**: Team needs to migrate from REST v2 to GraphQL before Q3 launch.

**Discussion**:
- Maria proposed a phased migration starting with read-only endpoints.
- Carlos raised concerns about client SDK compatibility.
- Group agreed on a 3-phase approach with a compatibility layer.

**Status**: Resolved

| ID | Decision | Owner | Date |
|----|----------|-------|------|
| D1 | Phased migration with compatibility layer | Maria R. | 2026-03-27 |

| ID | Action | Owner | Due Date | Priority | Status |
|----|--------|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| A1 | Draft migration RFC | Maria R. | 2026-04-03 | High | Open |
| A2 | Audit client SDK dependencies | Carlos P. | 2026-04-01 | High | Open |
```

Why it works: clear context, attributed discussion, linked decision and actions, dates assigned.

### Bad

```markdown
## Meeting Notes

We talked about the API migration. Some people think we should do GraphQL.
There was some disagreement. We decided to move forward.

TODO: someone should write something up about this.
```

Why it fails: no attribution, no decision detail, vague action item with no owner or date.

---

## Validation Gate

Before delivering the final meeting notes, confirm every item:

- [ ] Metadata block includes date, time, attendees, and facilitator (or marked [NOT PROVIDED])
- [ ] Each agenda/discussion item has context, discussion summary, and status
- [ ] Decision log uses unique IDs with rationale and owner columns
- [ ] Every action item has an assigned owner (person name, not team)
- [ ] Every action item has a due date (actual or [SUGGESTED])
- [ ] Speaker attribution is present where identifiable
- [ ] No editorializing or interpreting speaker intent
- [ ] Unresolved items are explicitly marked as Deferred or Escalated
- [ ] HTML output (if requested) uses brand colors #122562, #FFD700, #137DC5
- [ ] Follow-up section includes next meeting date and carry-over items
