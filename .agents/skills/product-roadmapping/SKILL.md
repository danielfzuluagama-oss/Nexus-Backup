# Product Roadmapping

> "Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable." — Dwight D. Eisenhower

## TL;DR

Builds strategic product roadmaps with evidence-based prioritization using RICE, MoSCoW, or Kano frameworks, aligned to business value streams and user needs. Use this skill when planning a new product, defining release strategy, or when the backlog needs strategic ordering beyond gut feeling. [EXPLICIT]

## Procedure

### Step 1: Discover
- Gather product vision, business objectives, and success metrics
- Inventory existing backlog items, feature requests, and technical debt
- Identify market pressures, deadlines, and competitive dynamics

### Step 2: Analyze
- Apply prioritization framework (RICE: Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)
- Categorize items using MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won't) per release
- Map features to value streams and user journey stages
- Identify dependencies and critical path items

### Step 3: Execute
- Create a time-horizon roadmap (Now / Next / Later) aligned to OKRs
- Define release themes with measurable outcomes, not just feature lists
- Build a prioritized backlog with scores and rationale for top items
- Document trade-offs and what was deprioritized with reasoning

### Step 4: Validate
- Verify prioritization scores are data-driven, not opinion-based
- Confirm dependencies are feasible within the proposed timeline
- Check that each release delivers user-facing value (no pure-tech releases)
- Review with stakeholders for alignment on trade-offs

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Roadmap uses outcome-oriented themes, not feature laundry lists
- [ ] Prioritization uses a consistent, documented framework
- [ ] Dependencies are mapped and validated against team capacity
- [ ] Each roadmap horizon has measurable success criteria
- [ ] Evidence tags applied to all claims

## Anti-Patterns

- Feature factory: roadmap as a list of features without strategic themes
- Date-driven roadmap that ignores scope uncertainty
- HiPPO prioritization (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) without framework
