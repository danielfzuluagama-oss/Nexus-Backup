## The Pipeline: 4 Phases

### PHASE 1 — INTAKE & EXTRACTION (Smart Auto)

**Goal**: Extract every valuable data point from the source CV.

1. **Read the CV** in whatever format provided (PDF, DOCX, TXT, image, pasted text)
   - For PDFs: use `pdfplumber` or `pypdf` for text extraction
   - For DOCX: use `pandoc` or unpack XML
   - For images: describe what you see and ask the user to confirm
   - For pasted text: parse structure directly

2. **Build the Candidate Profile JSON** — extract and organize:
   ```
   - Full name, contact info, location
   - Professional headline / current title
   - Career summary / objective
   - Work experience (company, title, dates, responsibilities, achievements)
   - Education (institution, degree, dates, honors)
   - Skills (technical, soft, tools, platforms)
   - Certifications & licenses
   - Languages
   - Publications, patents, speaking engagements
   - Volunteer work, side projects
   - Awards & recognitions
   ```

3. **Identify gaps** — flag missing but valuable information:
   - Quantified achievements (%, $, metrics)
   - Tool/platform proficiency levels
   - Certifications that might exist but aren't listed
   - Career progression narrative gaps

### PHASE 2 — ONLINE RESEARCH & ENRICHMENT

**Goal**: Discover public information about the candidate to enrich the CV.

Use web search to find: [EXPLICIT]
- **LinkedIn profile** — additional roles, endorsements, recommendations
- **Published work** — articles, talks, open source contributions
- **Company context** — what the companies they worked at do (to write better descriptions)
- **Industry keywords** — trending skills and terms in their field
- **Target role requirements** — if they mention a target job/company, research it

Save findings as enrichment data. Do NOT fabricate — only add verifiable public information. [EXPLICIT]

### PHASE 3 — CONFIRMATION & STRATEGY

**Goal**: Present findings and confirm with the user before generating.

Show the user a structured summary: [EXPLICIT]

```

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Ask the user to: [EXPLICIT]
1. Confirm accuracy of extracted data
2. Fill in any gaps (especially quantified achievements)
3. Specify target role/industry if not already clear
4. Choose language for outputs (or keep original)
5. Any special requests or preferences

### PHASE 4 — GENERATION (The 8 Outputs)

Once confirmed, generate all 8 outputs. Read the reference files before generating: [EXPLICIT]

- **Before DOCX outputs** → Read the `docx` skill's SKILL.md for docx-js patterns
- **Before HTML outputs** → Use the HTML template specs in `references/html-templates.md`
- **Before PPTX outputs** → Read the `pptx` skill's SKILL.md for pptxgenjs patterns
- **For design specs** → Read `references/design-specs.md`
- **For ATS optimization** → Read `references/ats-guide.md`
- **For content writing** → Read `references/content-guide.md`

---

## WOW Versions — Design Philosophy

The WOW versions are for **human eyes**. They should make a recruiter stop scrolling and pay attention. [EXPLICIT]

**Design principles:**
- Bold color accent (one signature color derived from the candidate's industry)
- Modern typography: header font with personality + clean body font
- Visual hierarchy: name dominates, then headline, then experience
- Micro-infographics: skill bars, timeline visualizations, metric callouts
- Whitespace as a design element — breathing room signals confidence
- One distinctive visual motif carried across all WOW outputs

**WOW DOCX** — Two-column layout, colored sidebar with skills/contact, main area with experience. Professional photo placeholder. Section dividers with accent color.

**WOW HTML** — Single-page responsive site. Smooth scroll navigation. Animated skill bars. Hover effects on experience cards. Print-friendly CSS. Dark/light theme toggle. Include the full HTML + CSS + JS in one file.

**WOW PPTX** — Each major section is a slide. Hero slide with name + photo placeholder + headline. Experience as visual timeline. Skills as icon grid. Dark background with accent color pops.

---

## ATS Versions — Optimization Philosophy

The ATS versions are for **machine parsing**. They must score 90%+ on ATS compatibility. [EXPLICIT]

**ATS rules (non-negotiable):**
- Single-column layout, no tables, no text boxes, no graphics
- Standard section headers: "Professional Experience", "Education", "Skills", "Certifications"
- Reverse chronological order
- Standard fonts: Calibri, Arial, or Garamond at 10-12pt
- .docx format preferred (best ATS parsing)
- No headers/footers (many ATS skip these)
- Keywords from target role woven naturally into content
- Both acronyms AND full terms (e.g., "SEO (Search Engine Optimization)")
- Bullet points with quantified achievements (70%+ should have metrics)
- Contact info in the body, not in header/footer

**ATS DOCX** — Clean, single-column. Name at top (16pt bold), then contact line, then sections. Each bullet starts with a power verb. Keywords density matches target role.

**ATS HTML** — Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy. No JavaScript. No CSS that hides text. Schema.org markup for structured data. Clean, readable even without CSS.

**ATS PPTX** — Text-heavy slides with standard formatting. Useful for recruiter presentations and internal candidate reviews. Clean, no animations.

---

## Cover Letter

Generate a compelling, tailored cover letter that: [EXPLICIT]
- Opens with a hook (not "I am writing to apply for...")
- Tells a story connecting the candidate's experience to the target role
- Highlights 2-3 most relevant achievements with metrics
- Shows knowledge of the company (from research phase)
- Closes with confidence and a clear call to action
- Matches the tone of the CV language (formal/casual, EN/ES)

Deliver as .docx with clean formatting. [EXPLICIT]

---

## LinkedIn Profile

Generate optimized sections: [EXPLICIT]
- **Headline** (120 chars max): Beyond just title — include value prop and keywords
- **About** (2600 chars max): First-person narrative, keyword-rich first 3 lines (visible above "see more"), achievement-focused
- **Experience entries**: Rewritten for LinkedIn's format (shorter paragraphs, more scannable)
- **Skills list**: Top 50 keywords for endorsement optimization

Deliver as .md with clear section markers. [EXPLICIT]

---

## Content Transformation Rules

When rewriting CV content, apply these transformations: [EXPLICIT]

### Achievement Formula
```
WEAK:  "Responsible for managing the sales team" [EXPLICIT]
STRONG: "Led 12-person sales team to 145% quota attainment ($3.2M ARR), [EXPLICIT]
         implementing data-driven coaching that reduced ramp time by 40%"
```

**Pattern**: [Power Verb] + [Scope/Scale] + [Result with Metric] + [Method/How]

### Power Verbs by Category
Read `references/content-guide.md` for the complete list, organized by: [EXPLICIT]
- Leadership: Spearheaded, Orchestrated, Championed, Pioneered
- Achievement: Exceeded, Outperformed, Surpassed, Accelerated
- Technical: Architected, Engineered, Automated, Optimized
- Growth: Scaled, Expanded, Launched, Grew
- Efficiency: Streamlined, Consolidated, Reduced, Eliminated

### Quantification Guide
- Revenue/savings → Dollar amounts ($, €, etc.)
- Efficiency → Percentage improvement (%)
- Scale → Team size, user count, transaction volume
- Time → Speed improvements, deadline adherence
- Quality → Error reduction, satisfaction scores
