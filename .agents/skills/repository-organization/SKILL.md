# Repository Organization

> "Entropy is actively countered — the repo gets more organized over time, not less."

## TL;DR

Audits and improves repository structure for navigability and maintainability. Checks naming consistency (kebab-case slugs), directory patterns (self-documenting layout), file organization (no accumulation without structure), and staleness (empty/outdated directories). Implements Constitution XVIII auto-organization: when files accumulate without structure, organize into named subdirectories with READMEs. [EXPLICIT]

## Procedure

### Step 1: Discover
- Scan full directory tree
- Check naming conventions across all directories and files
- Identify directories with >10 files (candidates for sub-organization)
- Check for empty directories
- Read .gitignore for completeness

### Step 2: Analyze
- **Naming audit**: all directories kebab-case? All files follow conventions?
- **Pattern consistency**: do similar components follow same directory layout?
- **Accumulation check**: any directory with >10 unorganized files?
- **Staleness**: empty directories? Directories with no recent commits?
- **Workspace separation**: any transient files outside workspace/?

### Step 3: Execute
- Generate organization report with findings and recommendations
- For accumulated files: propose subdirectory structure with READMEs
- For naming violations: propose renames (with impact assessment)
- For empty directories: propose removal
- For stale directories: flag for review
- Auto-generate READMEs for any directory missing one

### Step 4: Validate
- All directories follow naming conventions
- No directory has >10 unorganized files
- No empty directories remain
- All transient files are in workspace/
- Every directory has a README
- Report is actionable (specific paths, specific recommendations)

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Full directory tree scanned
- [ ] Naming conventions checked
- [ ] Accumulation flagged (>10 files)
- [ ] Empty directories flagged
- [ ] Stale directories flagged
- [ ] Recommendations are specific and actionable
- [ ] Evidence tags applied
