# Change Readiness

> "People don't resist change. They resist being changed." — Peter Senge

## TL;DR

Evaluates organizational readiness for technology or process changes using the ADKAR model, identifies resistance sources, and designs targeted interventions to ensure successful adoption. Use this skill before major rollouts, platform migrations, or when previous change initiatives have struggled. [EXPLICIT]

## Procedure

### Step 1: Discover
- Identify the change scope: what is changing, who is affected, and what stays the same
- Assess the organization's change history and fatigue level
- Map affected groups by function, location, and change impact severity

### Step 2: Analyze
- Evaluate each affected group on ADKAR dimensions (1-5 scale):
  - **Awareness**: Do they know why the change is happening?
  - **Desire**: Do they want to participate and support the change?
  - **Knowledge**: Do they know how to change?
  - **Ability**: Can they implement the change day-to-day?
  - **Reinforcement**: Are there mechanisms to sustain the change?
- Map resistance sources: fear of job loss, comfort with status quo, past failures, lack of trust
- Identify the weakest ADKAR dimension — this is the barrier point

### Step 3: Execute
- Design targeted interventions for each barrier point per affected group
- Create a communication plan addressing Awareness and Desire gaps
- Design training programs addressing Knowledge gaps
- Plan coaching and support systems for Ability gaps
- Establish recognition and measurement systems for Reinforcement

### Step 4: Validate
- Verify interventions target the actual barrier point, not assumed ones
- Confirm sponsors are trained and actively visible in their support
- Check that success metrics go beyond adoption rate (include satisfaction, productivity)
- Validate timeline allows for learning curves and adjustment periods

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] All affected groups assessed on all 5 ADKAR dimensions
- [ ] Barrier points identified with specific interventions designed
- [ ] Communication plan addresses why before how
- [ ] Resistance mapping includes specific engagement strategies
- [ ] Evidence tags applied to all claims

## Anti-Patterns

- Training-only change management (skipping Awareness and Desire)
- Big-bang rollout without pilot or phased approach
- Measuring adoption by tool login counts instead of outcome metrics

## Related Skills

- `stakeholder-mapping` — identifies who is affected and their influence
- `workshop-design` — facilitates change readiness sessions
- `executive-pitch` — secures sponsor commitment for change initiatives

## Usage

Example invocations:

- "/change-readiness" — Run the full change readiness workflow
- "change readiness on this project" — Apply to current context


## Assumptions & Limits

- Assumes access to project artifacts (code, docs, configs) [EXPLICIT]
- Requires English-language output unless otherwise specified [EXPLICIT]
- Does not replace domain expert judgment for final decisions [EXPLICIT]
