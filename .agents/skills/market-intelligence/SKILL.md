# Market Intelligence — Deep Research with Evidence Architecture

> TL;DR: Full-spectrum market intelligence on any entity — company, person, territory, or sector — delivered as a branded JM Labs HTML report with evidence chips.

**Principio Rector:** Evidence over assumption. Every claim carries an evidence tag. No speculation presented as fact.

---

## When to Activate

**Activate when:**
- User says "market intelligence", "market research", "geographic analysis", "sector analysis"
- User says "competitive landscape", "research X company", "profile on X person"
- User says "contact points for", "entry strategy for [market]", "who are the players in [sector]"
- User needs a structured evidence-backed report on a market, company, or public figure [EXPLICIT]

**Do NOT activate when:**
- User needs a quick one-liner fact (use WebSearch directly instead)
- User is asking about internal company data they own (use input-analysis skill)
- Request is purely financial modeling (use cost-estimation skill)

## S1 — Input Classification

Classify the target entity before starting research. This determines the research path and data sources. [EXPLICIT]

| Entity Type | Definition | Primary Sources |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Company** | Legal entity, product or service org | LinkedIn, Crunchbase, official site, news |
| **Person** | Executive, politician, influencer, decision maker | LinkedIn, Twitter/X, press, company bios |
| **Territory** | City, region, country, metro area | Government data, chamber of commerce, World Bank |
| **Sector** | Industry vertical, market segment | Gartner, IBISWorld, Statista, trade associations |

**Classification Protocol:**
1. Parse user input for entity name and type [EXPLICIT]
2. If ambiguous (e.g., "Amazon" — company or territory?), ask one clarifying question [INFERRED]
3. If entity has multiple dimensions (e.g., a sector in a territory), run both tracks [INFERRED]
4. Log classification decision with rationale before proceeding [OPEN]

## S5 — Output — Branded HTML Report

Generate a self-contained HTML file using JM Labs brand system. [EXPLICIT]

**Brand Tokens to Apply:**
```css
:root {
  --jml-navy:  #122562;
  --jml-gold:  #FFD700;
  --jml-blue:  #137DC5;
  --jml-bg:    #0d1b3e;
  --jml-surface: rgba(255,255,255,0.05);
  --font-head: 'Poppins', sans-serif;   /* 600-900 weight */
  --font-body: 'Inter', sans-serif;     /* 400-800 weight */
}
```

**HTML Structure:**
```
<div class="jml-doc">
  <header class="slide">   <!-- Hero with title, subtitle, date -->
  <section class="bridge"> <!-- Executive summary / key findings -->
  <section class="mv">     <!-- Main content sections (S1-S4 findings) -->
  <section class="ml">     <!-- Evidence log / sources -->
  <footer class="cta">     <!-- Next steps / recommended actions -->
</div>
```

**Evidence Chips Pattern:**
```html
<span class="src explicit">[EXPLICIT]</span>
<span class="src inferred">[INFERRED]</span>
<span class="src open">[OPEN]</span>
```

**Bilingual Support (ES/EN):**
```html
<span data-l="es">Inteligencia de Mercado</span>
<span data-l="en">Market Intelligence</span>
```
JavaScript toggle between `data-l="es"` and `data-l="en"` via `.gold` button.

**Report Sections:**
1. Executive Summary (key findings, 3-5 bullets)
2. Entity Profile (classification + core facts)
3. Market Position / Competitive Landscape
4. Contact Intelligence (S4 output)
5. Opportunity Map (where to engage, why, how)
6. Evidence Log (all sources with URLs and access date)
7. Recommended Next Steps

## S6 — Evidence Tagging Protocol

Apply evidence tags to **every factual claim** in all outputs. No exceptions. [EXPLICIT]

| Tag | Meaning | Usage Rule |
|----|--------|-----------|
| `[EXPLICIT]` | Directly stated by a primary source | Use for facts from official sites, filings, press releases |
| `[INFERRED]` | Derived logically from available signals | Use for estimates, pattern-based conclusions |
| `[OPEN]` | Unknown — requires further research | Use when data gap exists but matters to the user |

**Tagging Discipline:**
- Untagged claims are forbidden in MOAT-grade outputs [EXPLICIT]
- If a claim cannot be tagged, it must be removed or converted to a question [INFERRED]
- [OPEN] tags must include a note on how to resolve them [EXPLICIT]

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Dimension | Quick (1h) | Standard (4h) | Deep (8h+) |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Source depth | Top 10 web results | 30+ sources, cross-validated | Full OSINT + database sweep |
| Person profile | LinkedIn + basic bio | + Social + media coverage | + Network map + influence score |
| Contact intel | Email pattern only | + LinkedIn + gatekeeper | + Event calendar + warm intro path |
| Output format | Markdown summary | Branded HTML report | HTML + CSV + exec briefing |
| Confidence level | Medium | High | Very High |

---

## Assumptions & Limits

- Public data only — no hacking, no social engineering, no dark web [EXPLICIT]
- Email patterns are inferred, never verified without testing [EXPLICIT]
- Territory data accuracy depends on recency of government data sources [INFERRED]
- Sector size figures (TAM/SAM/SOM) must cite source and vintage year [EXPLICIT]
- Person profiles respect privacy: only publicly available information [EXPLICIT]
- Real-time web search required for current signals; static knowledge has cutoff [EXPLICIT]

---

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|---------|
| Entity has same name as another (e.g., "Amazon" river vs. company) | Clarify with one question before starting; log disambiguation decision |
| Company is stealth / pre-launch with minimal public presence | Flag as [OPEN], deliver what exists, list data gaps explicitly |
| Public figure has scrubbed their online presence | Document what was found, note the scrubbing as signal, do not speculate |
| Territory has unreliable government data (conflict zone, sanctions) | Use World Bank / IMF as primary; flag reliability concern |
| User requests information on a minor (person under 18) | Refuse the person profile; redirect to the organization they're associated with |

---

## Good vs Bad Example

**BAD (untagged, vague):**
> "Company X is growing fast and has about 500 employees. They use Salesforce."

**GOOD (tagged, sourced, specific):**
> "Company X had 487 employees as of Q3 2024 per LinkedIn headcount [EXPLICIT]. Revenue estimated at $40-60M based on Series B raise of $15M (2023) and SaaS multiples [INFERRED]. Salesforce usage confirmed via BuiltWith scan [EXPLICIT]. Hiring 12 open roles in Engineering as of research date [EXPLICIT]."

---
