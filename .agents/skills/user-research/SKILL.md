# User Research

> "You are not your user." — UX Research Axiom

## TL;DR

Creates personas, empathy maps, and user journey maps from qualitative and quantitative research to ground product decisions in real user needs. Use this skill when starting a new product, redesigning an experience, or when the team is making assumptions about user behavior without evidence. [EXPLICIT]

## Procedure

### Step 1: Discover
- Define research objectives and key questions to answer
- Identify user segments and recruit representative participants
- Choose research methods: interviews, surveys, contextual inquiry, analytics review

### Step 2: Analyze
- Synthesize research data using affinity diagrams and thematic analysis
- Build personas with demographics, goals, frustrations, and behavioral patterns
- Create empathy maps: what users Say, Think, Do, and Feel
- Map user journeys with touchpoints, emotions, pain points, and opportunities

### Step 3: Execute
- Document 2-4 primary personas with photo, bio, goals, and pain points
- Create empathy maps for each persona capturing emotional and behavioral insights
- Build end-to-end user journey maps with stages, actions, and sentiment curves
- Identify "moments of truth" — critical touchpoints that determine satisfaction

### Step 4: Validate
- Verify personas are based on research data, not stereotypes
- Confirm journey maps include both positive and negative emotional states
- Cross-check findings with quantitative analytics data
- Validate with stakeholders that personas represent target user segments

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Personas are research-backed with cited data sources
- [ ] Empathy maps capture all four quadrants (Say, Think, Do, Feel)
- [ ] User journeys cover the complete experience lifecycle
- [ ] Pain points are linked to specific improvement opportunities
- [ ] Evidence tags applied to all claims

## Anti-Patterns

- Personas based on assumptions rather than research data
- Journey maps that only show the happy path
- Research theater: conducting research but ignoring findings

## Assumptions & Limits

- Assumes access to project artifacts (code, docs, configs) [EXPLICIT]
- Requires English-language output unless otherwise specified [EXPLICIT]
- Does not replace domain expert judgment for final decisions [EXPLICIT]
