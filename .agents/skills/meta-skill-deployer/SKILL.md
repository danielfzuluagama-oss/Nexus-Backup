# meta-skill-deployer {Meta} (v1.0)

> **"Skills that create, review, search, and deploy other skills."**

## Purpose
Installs/deploys skills into target projects. Copies skill directory, updates index, configures project. [EXPLICIT]

**When to use:** When a project needs specific skills activated.

## Core Principles
1. **Law of Copy:** Deploy = copy skill directory to target .agent/skills/. [EXPLICIT]
2. **Law of Index:** After deploy, regenerate skills_index.json. [EXPLICIT]
3. **Law of Compatibility:** Only deploy skills compatible with target stack (R-002, R-003). [EXPLICIT]

## Core Process
### Phase 1: Validate skill exists and is production-ready (status: production).
### Phase 2: Copy skill directory to target project.
### Phase 3: Update target skills_index.json via meta-skill-indexer.

## Validation Gate
- [ ] Operation completed successfully
- [ ] skills_index.json updated if needed
- [ ] context.json reflects current state
- [ ] No stack violations (R-002, R-003)

## 4. Self-Correction Triggers
> [!WARNING]
> IF skills_index.json is stale THEN regenerate before searching.
> IF deploying a skill with status != production THEN WARN user.

## Usage

Example invocations:

- "/meta-skill-deployer" — Run the full meta skill deployer workflow
- "meta skill deployer on this project" — Apply to current context


## Assumptions & Limits

- Assumes access to project artifacts (code, docs, configs) [EXPLICIT]
- Requires English-language output unless otherwise specified [EXPLICIT]
- Does not replace domain expert judgment for final decisions [EXPLICIT]

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Empty or minimal input | Request clarification before proceeding |
| Conflicting requirements | Flag conflicts explicitly, propose resolution |
| Out-of-scope request | Redirect to appropriate skill or escalate |
