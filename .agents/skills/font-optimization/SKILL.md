# Font Optimization

> "Typography is the voice of design — make sure it doesn't stutter on load." — Unknown

## TL;DR

Guides web font optimization to eliminate invisible text (FOIT) and layout shifts (FOUT) — covers font-display strategies, preloading critical fonts, Unicode range subsetting, variable fonts for weight reduction, and self-hosting vs CDN tradeoffs. Use when custom fonts are causing performance issues or layout shifts. [EXPLICIT]

## Procedure

### Step 1: Discover
- Inventory all fonts in use (families, weights, styles)
- Measure font impact on CLS and FCP with Lighthouse
- Check current loading method (Google Fonts CDN, self-hosted, @import)
- Identify which fonts are critical (above-the-fold) vs decorative

### Step 2: Analyze
- Determine minimum character set needed (latin, latin-ext, specific glyphs)
- Evaluate variable font availability (one file replaces multiple weight files)
- Plan font-display strategy (`swap` for body, `optional` for non-critical)
- Calculate total font payload and compare with subsetting savings

### Step 3: Execute
- Self-host fonts for better performance (eliminate third-party DNS lookup)
- Subset fonts to only needed Unicode ranges using `glyphhanger` or `pyftsubset`
- Implement `font-display: swap` in `@font-face` declarations
- Preload critical fonts: `<link rel="preload" href="font.woff2" as="font" crossorigin>`
- Use WOFF2 format exclusively (best compression, 95%+ browser support)
- Replace multiple weight files with a single variable font where possible

### Step 4: Validate
- Confirm no FOIT — text is always visible during font loading
- Measure CLS impact — font swap should cause minimal layout shift
- Verify font files are cached with long-lived Cache-Control headers
- Check total font payload is under 100KB for all critical fonts

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] All fonts served in WOFF2 format
- [ ] Critical fonts preloaded with `rel="preload"`
- [ ] `font-display` set appropriately for each font family
- [ ] Font files subsetted to required character ranges only
- [ ] Evidence tags applied to all claims

## Anti-Patterns

- Loading 6+ font weights when the design only uses 2-3
- Using `@import` in CSS to load Google Fonts (render-blocking)
- Setting `font-display: block` which causes invisible text during load
